First encountered on Prince Olthanis' cloud castle, where she acted as an advisor to Olthanis. Appeared to betray the prince when he refused to attack Waterdeep and set the castle on a collision course with Blackstaff Tower before using a teleport spell to escape. Last seen at Silverymoon alongside Thane Kalithica leading a Stone Giant assault on the city.
