The Cassalanter noble house of Waterdeep is among one of the richest families within the city, and by extension, one of the richest in the entire region of the Sword Coast. 
They made their fortune in banking, money-lending, real estate, and rumor-mongering for the highest payer. As of this generation, Ohrl Cassalanter has made philanthropy a larger focus of the Cassalanter empire. 

The family owns a large estate within the city's Sea Ward. 

Ohrl Cassalanter - the family's patriarch
Sylull Cassalanter - Lady of House Cassalanter; likes pink, likes miniature poodles
Panricon Cassalanter - the eldest son of Ohrl and Sylull, and heir apparent to the family empire. Reputation for incompetence, pettiness, and greed. 
Caladorn Cassalanter - middle child; not particularly interested in participating in the family business
Myrna Cassalanter - youngest child and only daughter of Ohrl and Sylull. 
Lia Cassalanter - Ohrl's half-elf sister
