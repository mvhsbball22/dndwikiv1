### Silja the Archaeologist

Ice climbing to find the [Eye of the Oldfather](/home/ice-cave).  Looking to find treasure and/or the oracle.

Once expressed sympathy to Savian in the Eye of the All-Father for his situation after recognizing the collar around his neck. Savien, defiantly pointing to the collar said quote, "This is a lifestyle choice" Silja shrugged and dropped the matter.
