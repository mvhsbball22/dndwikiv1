## Raven Rock
Giant mounds, the middle with a huge sculpture of a raven.
About 14 other horse-sized ravens (these ones alive).
Largo has the idea to distract the ravens with food - the group gets a crate from the ship.
They put the meat on the mound, and the ravens all start to eat it. 
This gives the crew time to search the burial mounds, but all they find is human remains.
When the sun rises, most of the ravens fly away, leaving two. 
Steve tries to talk to one, and Orel helps by casting Tongues, so Steve can both speak and understand the raven language.
