## Raven Rock
Giant mounds, the middle with a huge sculpture of a raven.
About 14 other horse-sized ravens (these ones alive).
Largo has the idea to distract the ravens with food - the group gets a crate from the ship.
They put the meat on the mound, and the ravens all start to eat it. 
This gives the crew time to search the burial mounds, but all they find is human remains.
When the sun rises, most of the ravens fly away, leaving two. 
Steve tries to talk to one, and Orel helps by casting Tongues, so Steve can both speak and understand the raven language.

## Morgur's Mound

Following an unsuccessful day of digging at Morgur's Mound, the group decided that this was a task that required some amount of delegation (as well as proper digging tools). Savien volunteered himself for travel to Neverwinter to hire a team of skilled laborers to excavate the mound while the rest of the group travelled onwards to Flint Rock, the site of the next relic. Before any of this could transpire, the group was set upon by a flock of vulture mounted solicitors preaching the word of Yan C'Bin. The group was unenthused, but eventually agreed to attend a monthly meeting in exchange for help with the excavation at MM. With a crew of 24 shovel bearing Neverwintians, Foreman Savien gave instruction to begin dismantling the mound in an orderly fashion, and after some time the relic is discovered in a large sinkhole. Suddenly, enormous bone-constructs erupted from the ground and began crushing  the laborers. With a keen interest in not dying : Savien creates a dimensional door to the deck of the air ship, and retrieves the relic (accidentally saving a worker in the process) [!LOL - editor's note]. Savien then made attempts to aid the fleeing workers , but they were largely ineffective. 9 laborers perished during these events , and the remainder we're not pleased. Ultimately demanding additional gold for their troubles. It should be noted that the aformentioned air-worshipers never made good on their promise to assist in the excavation. The recovered relic is a **giant's tooth**. 


## Flint Rock
At Flint Rock, the group sans Savien began to search a heavily fogged mire for any signs of a relic, eventually discovering a large altar which Largo deduced was hollow through experimentation with knocking. The events that led to the recovery of a giant relic from that altar can only be described as a bizarre physics problem involving Orel chewing a large quantity of moss, an enormous elk, and of course: some rope. The relic appears to be a giant-sized **mithril spear head**. 

## One Stone
At one stone, Lia and Aloine attempt to survey site only to be accosted by a cultist who pulls back his robe to reveal a severely distended abdomen which promptly bursts with a foul and toxic black soil. It appears that The Black Earth are working with some foul magic which we were previously unfamiliar with.
Reunited with the group, it is clear that the ~20 cultists are closely guarding something in the center of the ruins where there stands a single tent.
Savien proposes a plan to infiltrate the camp stealthily, which meant keeping Orel and Lia nearby in case a fight errupted.
Due to a miscommunication between Steve and Orel, it seemed that a telepathic communication would be the route by which Orel would be alerted of the need to charge into battle.
Since that call was impossible to make, the group was separated with no means of communication.
Orel assumed that because the call for help never came, he was not needed to fight.
Left to his own devices, Orel began to inspect his battle wound from the previous site - and noticed that it was looking far worse than he remembered.
Severely concerned, he made the decision to steer the air ship towards Silverymoon in search of a priest.
At this point, the group had made their way to the base ruins, and Savien told the group to wait for his signal (a lot of miscommunication via signals this game) and opened up a dimensional door and stepped through.
The door Savien opened led to the inside of the tent at the center of the ruins.
Instead of finding a giant relic, Savien is grappled by an incredibly strong half orc who states that he won't free savien until he cuts his restraints.
In no position to argue, Savien does just that. Once freed, Rath introduces himself briefly - making it clear that his intentions are to retrieve his weapon and slaughter those who bound him.
Savien gives the signal to Steve, Largo and Aloine and the begin a ranged siege on the ruins; picking off several cultists.
Savien and Rath use this sudden chaos as an opening to launch their own attack, and Rath successfully attacks the lead cultist Mirage before he is able to use strong magic to disable him.
It appears that Mirage's powers were severely underestimated, as the fight continues he summons several massive beasts to his side.
In an attempt to stop what he assumes will be a one sided slaughter, Savien tries to reason with Mirage who is tight-lipped about their business at One Stone, but does say that he is looking for Orel and Lia.
After some vomit worthy buttering-up of a random cultist, Savien is able to glean that Mirage is after Lia due to her purchase of the Quarry in Redlarch. and Orel due to the spread of his religion in the area.
After promising Mirage that the quary will be released, the cultists depart, and the group is left alone at One Stone.
That is until a Sky Pony war party descends on the group.
Severely outnumbered yet again - Aloine casts pass without a trace and the entire group is able to disappear into the tree line before the Sky Pony can loose their arrows.

## Beorunna's Well
Approaching the final site, Rath reveals that Beorunna's Well is the worship place of the Red Tiger and Black Lion tribes. Savien comes up with a plan to disguise themselves in the ceremonial garb of these tribes based on Rath's description, and to infiltrate in search of the relic. After donning some half-baked disguises, Savien and Rath repel into the cavern and approach the inhabitants who are situated around a large fire. In the distance Savien spots what looks like a large spiked and winged black lion sleeping in the distance. Unable to speak Uthgart, Savien listens as Rath does his best to prove their legitimacy. When weapons are drawn and an Axe finds itself deeply imbeded into the skull of the Black Lion party leader, it becomes abundantly clear that negotiations have failed. Steve and Aloine launch ranged attacks into the cavern as Lia and Orel begin their rope descent. As Rath continues his assault, several more Black Lion tribesmen emerge from the nearby tents, including an elder shaman who Steve identifies as a priority target, and springs into action. Steve drives a dagger into the shamans torso, but through gritted teeth she is able to mutter a curse before Aloine puts an arrow through the back of her head.
Rath cuts down several more Black Lion with Saviens support, when suddenly a fierce roar let's loose from the cave and the Black Lion that Savien had spotted takes flight and begins pelting Orel with spikes. Caught halfway between the cave floor and the top, Orel scrambles back up the rope and is able to cast (sacred flame?) on the Lion. Rath and Aloine make quick work of the remaining tribesmen, leaving no survivors as Savien watches, equal parts impressed and horrified. Orel, Lia and Steve are able to drive the lion off as Aloine watches, stunned by the majesty of such a beast. Following inspection of the cave, it becomes apparent that the relic must be within the sarcofagus at the center. As Savien and Rath crack the lid on the tomb, it comes to everyone's attention that Steve has become partially paralyzed as a result of the shamans curse. With the relic retrieved, the airship is loaded and the party makes way for the eye of the alfather. Orel is able to cure Steve of his curse. The relic found at this site was a **mammoth tusk**.
