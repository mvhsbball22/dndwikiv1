## Raven Rock
Giant mounds, the middle with a huge sculpture of a raven.
About 14 other horse-sized ravens (these ones alive).
Largo has the idea to distract the ravens with food - the group gets a crate from the ship.
They put the meat on the mound, and the ravens all start to eat it. 
This gives the crew time to search the burial mounds, but all they find is human remains.
When the sun rises, most of the ravens fly away, leaving two. 
Steve tries to talk to one, and Orel helps by casting Tongues, so Steve can both speak and understand the raven language.

## Morgur's Mound

Following an unsuccessful day of digging at Morgur's Mound, the group decided that this was a task that required some amount of delegation (as well as proper digging tools). Savien volunteered himself for travel to Neverwinter to hire a team of skilled laborers to excavate the mound while the rest of the group travelled onwards to Flint Rock, the site of the next relic. Before any of this could transpire, the group was set upon by a flock of vulture mounted solicitors preaching the word of X. The group was unenthused, but eventually agreed to attend a monthly meeting in exchange for help with the excavation at MM. With a crew of 24 shovel bearing Neverwintians, Foreman Savien gave instruction to begin dismantling the mound in an orderly fashion, and after some time the relic is discovered in a large sinkhole. Suddenly, enormous bone-constructs erupted from the ground and began crushing  the laborers. With a keen interest in not dying : Savien creates a dimensional door to the deck of the air ship, and retrieves the relic (accidentally saving a worker in the process). Savien then made attempts to aid the fleeing workers , but they were largely ineffective. 9 laborers perished during these events , and the remainder we're not pleased. Ultimately demanding additional gold for their troubles. It should be noted that the aformentioned air-worshipers never made good on their promise to assist in the excavation. The recovered relic is a **giant's tooth**. 


## Flint Rock
At Flint Rock, the group sans Savien began to search a heavily fogged mire for any signs of a relic, eventually discovering a large altar which Largo deduced was hollow through experimentation with knocking. The events that led to the recovery of a giant relic from that altar can only be described as a bizarre physics problem involving Orel chewing a large quantity of moss, an enormous elk, and of course: some rope. The relic appears to be a giant-sized **mithril spear head**. Aloine was able to glean some information r
