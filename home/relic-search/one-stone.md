<!-- TITLE: One Stone -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of One Stone -->
At one stone, Lia and Aloine attempt to survey site only to be accosted by a cultist who pulls back his robe to reveal a severely distended abdomen which promptly bursts with a foul and toxic black soil. It appears that The Black Earth are working with some foul magic which we were previously unfamiliar with. 
Reunited with the group, it is clear that the ~20 cultists are closely guarding something in the center of the ruins where there stands a single tent. 
Savien proposes a plan to infiltrate the camp stealthily, which meant keeping Orel and Lia nearby in case a fight errupted.
Due to a miscommunication between Steve and Orel, it seemed that a telepathic communication would be the route by which Orel would be alerted of the need to charge into battle.
Since that call was impossible to make, the group was separated with no means of communication. 
Orel assumed that because the call for help never came, he was not needed to fight.
Left to his own devices, Orel began to inspect his battle wound from the previous site - and noticed that it was looking far worse than he remembered.
Severely concerned, he made the decision to steer the air ship towards Silverymoon in search of a priest.
At this point, the group had made their way to the base ruins, and Savien told the group to wait for his signal (a lot of miscommunication via signals this game) and opened up a dimensional door and stepped through.
The door Savien opened led to the inside of the tent at the center of the ruins. 
Instead of finding a giant relic, Savien is grappled by an incredibly strong half orc who states that he won't free savien until he cuts his restraints.
In no position to argue, Savien does just that. Once freed, Rath introduces himself briefly - making it clear that his intentions are to retrieve his weapon and slaughter those who bound him.
Savien gives the signal to Steve, Largo and Aloine and the begin a ranged siege on the ruins; picking off several cultists.
Savien and Rath use this sudden chaos as an opening to launch their own attack, and Rath successfully attacks the lead cultist Mirage before he is able to use strong magic to disable him.
It appears that Mirage's powers were severely underestimated, as the fight continues he summons several massive beasts to his side. 
In an attempt to stop what he assumes will be a one sided slaughter, Savien tries to reason with Mirage who is tight-lipped about their business at One Stone, but does say that he is looking for Orel and Lia.
After some vomit worthy buttering-up of a random cultist, Savien is able to glean that Mirage is after Lia due to her purchase of the Quarry in Redlarch. and Orel due to the spread of his religion in the area. 
After promising Mirage that the quary will be released, the cultists depart, and the group is left alone at One Stone. 
That is until a Sky Pony war party descends on the group.
Severely outnumbered yet again - Aloine casts pass without a trace and the entire group is able to disappear into the tree line before the Sky Pony can loose their arrows.
