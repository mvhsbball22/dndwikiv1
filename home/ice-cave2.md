# Return to The Eye of The All-Father
On arrival back at the Ice Cave, it is clear that much has happened since our last visit. The giant wurm that Orel, Largo and Steve encountered outside the door of the temple has been slain, and is now being dismembered by a large number of Uthgart.
The enterance to the giant wurm cavern has since been repaired. 
Rath is able to speak to the Uthgart who tell us that they came upon the beast in this state, and the assumption is made that this is the work of Harshnag.
Largo collects some wurm flesh for cooking.
Inside the temple Harshnag informs the group that Silja was killed by the wurm, and that indeed he is the wurm slayer. 
It is clear that Harshnag has been injured during his relic-hunting, and upon inspection, Orel is able to determine that he is afflicted by a curse which he is able to cure. 
Harshnag and Savien have a brief conversation about Rath, and his presence inside the temple. Harshnag agrees to not to kill Rath, but refuses him entry to this sacred place. 
Savien agrees to this, and offers to wait outside the temple with Rath.
The party begins unloading the relics and moving them into the inner sanctum where they disintegrate one-by-one as the oracle is consulted. 
The information gathered is as follows:
**Stone Giants : **Thane Calithica is a stone giant shaman. Travel southeast over lands high and low, cross the peaks to Deadstone Cleft. The conch you seek is in her possession. Of note: this is the giant that Lia and Orel recognize from Silverymoon.

**Frost Giants: ** Jarl Storevald is a frost giant lord. Travel west to The Sea of Moving Ice. Find Svardborg. The conch is  on his icy throne. Of note, this is the conch that was though to be unprotected.

**Cloud Giants: ** Countess Sansuri is the cloud giant lord. Travel southeast to The Moors and look at the sky. Lin'Amal is the kingdom of the Cloud Giants, and the magical conch can be found in a chest within the it's highest spire. Of note: this is the giant who is thought to be holding Harshnag's friend Thelgalos (Felgalos?) captive.

**Hill Giants:  ** Chief Guh is the hill giant lord. Travel south over "The Tree Hill" and let the river be your guide. Den-Grudd Haug is the kingdom the the hill giants, and the conch can be found close to it's lord.

**Fire Giants: ** Duke Xalto is the lord of the fire giants. Travel east to the mountains of the Yak Folk, below the iron slag you will find the forge of the fire giant Duke Xalto, the conch you seek is within his quarters.  Of note: this is the person who Savien promised to defeat, a promise which he is bound to by a magical choker.

Outside the temple, Savien questions Rath about his intentions, and it seems that the half-orc plans to stay with the group following his excommunication from his tribe.
Rath was even willing to give up posession of the relic retrieved from Raven Rock, which was known to be sacred amongst his people. 
Suddenly the crew of the air ship calls out a warning of "enemy fast approaching", and as Savien and Rath survey the sky they spot a large chromatic (blue) dragon fast approaching the airship.
Savien recommends that they abandon the airship and evacuate to the temple doors where they will have cover from the dragon's breath.
