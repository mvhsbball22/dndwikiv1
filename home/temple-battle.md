![Iymrith](/uploads/iymrith.jpg "Iymrith")

Savien, Rath and the airship crew rush into the Eye of the All Father where they run into the rest of the party and warn them of the impending dragon attack.
Delsephine identifies the dragon as Iymrith.
Iymrith is known as "the doom from the desert" her lair is in the eastern desert.
She is nearly 1000 years old and has spent a lot of that time studying magic.
Harshnag accuses one of the airship cultists of betrayal.
The cultists deny this claim.
Lia uses zone of truth to inspect each cultists true intentions.
Iymreth enters the temple and speaks to harshnag : "Rewards of virtue, harshnag"
She continues "Tiamat has surely smiled upon me today"
they are squaring up to fight, Harshnag equips himself with a large spear in one hand and his axe in the other.
He has instructed us to "stay behind him".
Identifying that this fight is one that he probably wont win, Harshnag instructs to group to leave him behind.
The group collectively decides that leaving Harshnag to die alone is not an option.

Iymrith presence in this temple to the giant gods is clearly unacceptable to Harshnag, and as she begins to damage the walls of this holy place, he becomes enraged, readying to attack. 
Harshnag approaches Iymreth with Orel and Rath following closely behind.
Iymrith animates a large chunk of granite that she has removed from the temple wall, it takes flight as a gargoyle. 
As the battle begins, Aloine uses Spiked Growt on Iymrith.
Orel manages to land two extremely effective 'Guiding Bolts' on Iymreth while Rath finds her volley of tail swipes too much to overcome. 
As an odor of ozone is noticed by Aloine, Iymrith opens her mouth wide and prepares a breath attack directed at Harshnag. 
Much like a completed circut, an arc of electrical current passes through Harshnag dealing a massive blow, but he reamins standing.
Aloine continues to loose arrows at Iymrith with mixed results.
In the backlines: Largo, Savien and Steve are contending with the granite gargoyle. The construct dives toward Savien -- who has positioned himself within the cowl of the All-Father at the center of the room. 
Working together, they are able to destroy the construct with several well placed arrows, and some psychic spell damage. 
Lia moves toward Iymreth to aid Orel, Rath and Harshnag.
Iymrith lets forth a horrifying roar, leaving Rath and Lia 'frightened' and unable to willfully move towards the her.
Harshang continues his assault on Iymrith with his axe while Orel supports with 'Prayer of Healing'. 
Iymrith prepares a second breath attack, this time dealing a massive blow to Lia, Orel and Harshnag. 
Harshnag and Orel remain standing, but Lia is knocked unconscious.
Orel returns Lia to consciousness with a second 'Prayer of Healing'.
Angered that we did not heed his warning, and identifying the futility of his attacks on Iymrith, Harshnag uses his axe to strike the central statue causing the temple to begin to crumble around us.

Harshnag yells out to the party "FLEE -- your fate lies elsewhere" and then turns to Iymrith, and looses his spear into the Dragon's side.
Harshnag grapples Iymrith, and it becomes apparent that he means to pin the dragon in place and sacrifice himself so that she may also die beneath the rubble.
The party begins to take significant damage from chunks of falling rubble, and it is clear that staying in this place means certain death.
Rath runs for Harshnag's axe, realizing that it's well over 300 lbs, he begins to drag it at a snails pace while taking damage from the falling granite.
Largo notices Rath and moves to help him with the axe, between the two of them they are able to move the massive weapon at a much more reasonable pace.
Savien remains in the cowl of the All Father and watches in horror as Harshnag is pelted by falling rubble he casts 'Heat Metal' on the mithril spear head which is deep inside Iymrith, causing her to roar in pain. 
The temple continues to crumble as Aloine and Hermes clear the room.
Steve spots Rath and Largo dragging the axe and calls out "many people have died with treasure in their hands you morons!" and runs past them, dodging rubble and exiting the temple.
Lia disappears under a massive chunk of granite as she flees from the temple, but in a display of strength, Orel frees her and drags her to safety.
Rath and Largo clear the room with Harshnag's axe as the temple continues to fall around them.
At this point, Savien, Harshnag and Iymrith remain in the temple.
Savien refuses to watch Harshnag die without trying to help him however he can.
Savien yells to Harshnag "release her and drink your shrinking potion, we aren't going to die in here!" 
With that said, Savien dashes accross the room, avoiding falling granite.
As he reaches the giant, Harshnag releases Iymrith who strikes the giant with a massive blow as she attempts to flee the chaos.
Harshnag is rendered unconscious by the attack.
Savien returns Harshag to consciousness just in time for a large chunk of the ceiling to the crush the giant, partially burrying him.
Identifying that he can do no more for Harshag, Savien reluctantly opens a Dimension Door to safety and steps through.
