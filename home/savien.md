## Savien
Savien plays his foes' heartstrings with whatever instrument he can find, and if that doesn't work, he finds the soft underbelly of their psyche and stabs with biting insults.
## Backstory
Savien Traliard spent less than a week with the famous "Milil's Merrymakers" before the troupe unanimously decided that he was better suited for a solo career. This did not come as much of a surprise to Savien, as he had spent much of his life alone and knew that a group of classically trained buffoons would never be able to make proper use of an artist of his calibre. Savien's love for ambience is rooted in a lonesome childhood where his time was largely spent listening to and categorizing (at length) "the sound of things " : things like wind rushing through a tree or twigs snapping underfoot. Proudly self-trained, Savien claims to be proficient with "any instrument made by man ... or otherwise"proof of this claim has yet to be seen.
