## The Ruins
The group walked toward a town in shambles.  Largo climbed on a tree to see whether danger lurked.  Eventually, everyone got over the ramparts and started exploring.

Eventually, they worked their way toward the town keep, where they battled ____.  Largo discovered a cache of scarves and made a fancy belt.

They left the keep and ran into a woman with a strange tattoo.  And they saw the missing STONE.  

As they left the town, they saw a dragon fly overhead.  They followed tracks into a cave.
