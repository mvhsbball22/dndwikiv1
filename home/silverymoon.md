Orel and Lia arrive at Silverymoon in search of a priest to rid Orel of the wound he endured in the battle with the dragon & giant phantoms.
Orel is able to find just that, and quickly he is cured.
Lia is shocked to find out that there are Cassalanters living in Silverymoon. Assuming they are imposters, she arrives at the "Cassalanter" manor where she is greeted by a maid / servant who rudely dispatches her. Exasperated, Lia returns to Orel in the town center where Silverymoon is quickly becoming much less serene.
As the town descends into chaos, it becomes clear that a group of Stone Giants and a distinguishable giant carrying a (staff?) have begun an assault on the city. 

[DM edit: staff wielding Stone Giant later identified at Eye of the All-Father as the shaman Thane Kalithica. A familiar female storm giant was present at this attack with her - Balakar, an advisor to the young cloud giant Prince Olthanis. Images of both giants posted on the wiki; Balakar has her own page]

With the compulsion to avert the attack on Silverymoon, Orel comandeers an airship led by a crew of less-than-happy dwarves and begins a straffing run on the giants with balista bolts.
After landing a single shot, the air ship is unsustainably damaged, and plummets towards the ground. 
With only 5 available parachutes, Orel is left alone on the ship as it crashes into the ground.
Lia follows behind, and with some quick salvage she is able to pull Orel from the wreckage and bring his Back from the Brink of death.
With Orel clinging to consciousness, Lia make's the decision to regroup.
