The group arrived in Everlund.

Talked to nimblewright in the attic of the church.  After finding a way to talk to him, the group determined that he built a nimblewright.  They found the creator and trader of nimblewrights docked at port.  He was interested to learn that one nimblewright created another and gave the group a tool to find nimblewrights.  Largo took control of the nimblewright detector and led the group to a fancy area of town.  

Steve cased the back of the mansion while Savien peered in the upper-story windows.  Steve discovered a trail of wetness leading into the back of the house.  Simultaneously, the group found the nimblewright in a garbage can and roped it closed.

Part of the group followed the wetprints into the basement and found two rooms: one was frozen completely and contained a fungus that Largo inhaled; the other had an assassin and some shark assistants, which were quickly dispatched (someone got nicked with the assassin's blade and got hit with a deadly poison).

The group met up and took the nimblewright in garbage can to the docks.  Once the group discovered the nimblewright was completed destroyed, Orel mended it to the best of his ability. The nimblewright-crafter translated a conversation for the group. The group headed back to the mansion and found it swarming with police.  Brazenly, Savien and Orel decided a truthful approach was best - it wasn't.  The lieutenant suspected the group's involvement and paraded them to the local jail dungeon.

After interrogation, the local authorities exiled the entire group from Everlund.
