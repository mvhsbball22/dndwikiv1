### Entry
After a long journey from Everlund, the group led by [Harshnag](/people/harshnag) arrived at a cave.  Upon entry, they were confronted by a group of people - who, unfortunately, did not speak common, giant, or abyssal.

### Fight with the welcome crew

### The split
Aloine, Lia, and Savien head to the north while Largo, Steve, and Orel head through a fissure to the West.

Deep in the ice caces, Large, Steve, and Orel run into multiple groups of small icy spiders.  Attacking in groups of three to five, their mandibles pierce the skin, forcing our heroes to resist being chilled to the bone.  Sensing their overwhelming strength, one spider attempts to escape by freezing a barricade into the tunnel -- however, Orel smashes the barricade and mutters a prayer to his god, allowing Largo to dash through and smash the spider into steam. The characters are left with a distinct visual afterimage of a heated imprint of Orel's god seared into Largo's trusty cast iron frying pan.

Meanwhile, Savien, Lia, and Aloine step into a tunnel, unwittingly triggering a giant boulder to crash through the room.
