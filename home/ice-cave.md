### Entry
After a long journey from Everlund, the group led by [Harshnag](/people/harshnag) arrived at a cave.  Upon entry, they were confronted by a group of people - who, unfortunately, did not speak common, giant, or abyssal.

### Fight with the welcome crew

### The split
Aloine, Lia, and Savien head to the north while Largo, Steve, and Orel head through a fissure to the West.

Deep in the ice caces, Large, Steve, and Orel run into multiple groups of small icy spiders.  Attacking in groups of three to five, their mandibles pierce the skin, forcing our heroes to resist being chilled to the bone. 

Meanwhile, Savien, Lia, and Aloine step into a tunnel, unwittingly triggering a giant boulder to crash through the room.
