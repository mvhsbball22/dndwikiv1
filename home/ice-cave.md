### Entry
After a long journey from Everlund, the group led by [Harshnag](/people/harshnag) arrived at a cave.  Upon entry, they were confronted by a group of people - who, unfortunately, did not speak common, giant, or abyssal.

### Fight with the welcome crew

The group walks into the cave and were immediately greeted by several people, none of whom speak a language that our heroes can understand, despite Orel running through a litany of options.  Largo puts forward a very peaceful overture by sitting down and seeming as non-threatening as possible.  Before his butt could hit the ground (which, remember, is not far removed given his short statute), Orel and Savien strike the apparent leader.  A short scuffle ends with Orel holding aloft the amulet previously worn by his downed foe, and the remaining Uthgardt people immediately consider Orel their leader.  

With the meager resistance overcome, the group heads deeper into the mountain and discovers a room featuring large statues, and exits to each of the cardinal directions.

### The split
Aloine, Lia, and Savien head to the north while Largo, Steve, and Orel head through a fissure to the West.

#### Largo, Steve, and Orel
Deep in the ice caces, Large, Steve, and Orel run into multiple groups of small icy spiders.  Attacking in groups of three to five, their mandibles pierce the skin, forcing our heroes to resist being chilled to the bone.  Steve dismembered one spider, keeping a vial of [icy liquid](/items/icy-spider-juice) for himself and slicing [several legs](/items/icy-spider-legs) for Largo to keep.  Sensing their overwhelming strength, one spider attempts to escape by freezing a barricade into the tunnel -- however, Orel smashes the barricade and mutters a prayer to his god, allowing Largo to dash through and smash the spider into steam. The characters are left with a distinct visual afterimage of a heated imprint of Orel's god seared into Largo's trusty cast iron frying pan.

The group finds a large room with a giant ice spider and several smaller spiders protecting a brood of (presumably) sipder eggs.  Heroically, Orel charges to the middle of the room, aiming to smash a natural stone column and disrupt the extensive protective icy web system.  His vision (perhaps clouded from his earlier ice cloud encounter) betrayed him, and he misjudged the location of the large spider, who blasted him with a coating of ice, freezing him in stone.  Largo and Steve rush into the room and push the block back into the tunnels.  Largo heats up his cast iron pan and smashes Orel free.  Discretion being the better part of valor, the three continue to explore the tunnels, leaving the spider queen to her machinations.

Further exploration reveals an opening to the side of the mountain housing the cave system.  Largo and Orel leave some souvenirs of their visit...  Further search uncovers a second large chamber and three blocks of ice (an exsanguinated mountain goat, an unfortunate halfling mountain climber, and surprisingly a living but frozen dwarf woman).  Orel carries the dwarf woman through the tunnels.

#### Savien, Lia, and Aloine (and Hermes)
Meanwhile, Savien, Lia, and Aloine step into a tunnel, unwittingly triggering a giant boulder to crash through the room.  

### Short reunion
The group meets back together in the main room -- and they are shortly joined by the Uthgardt people the group met when first arriving at the temple, who are marching into the dungeon while chanting in a language that nobody understands.  Orel wants to embrace his new role as chief of the tribe and immediately takes the lead, teaching his people new/more contemporary dances.  A disagreement erupts, with [Harshnag](/people/harshnag) vehemently forbidding any of the Uthgardt from staying in the halls, which seem to be sacred to him.  Orel, Largo and Steve accompany the tribespeople to the entry hallway and proceed to feast on goat while Harshnag, Lia, Aloine and Savien turn in next to the fire in the dining hall. 

In the entryway, a leadership challenge erupts between Steve and Orel -- Steve makes a snowball and Orel smacks him with his (???).  Largo is impressed with the cooking of a young Uthgardt and they make a connection over the food.  Largo cleverly expresses his satisfaction enthusiastically with hand motions and high fives.  The group settles in for an evening of conversation and everyone heads to sleep.  Everything is going well until...

A giant centipede crashes through the wall and consumes a member of the local tribe in one bite while sailing toward the opposite wall.  Despite their best efforts, the combination of the remaining Uthgardt and Orel, Steve and Largo cannot stop the flying centipede from crashing through the walls and consuming another tribesman before it disappears into the rocks for good.  Largo, Orel and Steve help the locals pack their tent hurriedly, bid them adieu as they head into the cold, and head back into the feast room to sleep with their comrades.

### Back into the crack
While the revelers were still sleeping, Silja asks Steve to sneak into the spider caves to retrieve her pack, and displaying his usual ruthlessness, makes her agree to relinquish her warhammer in exchange for the group's aid.  Based on his earlier experience with the ice spider queen, Steve demurs, opting instead to muster the entire group to head back into the cave complex.  It doesn't take too much convincing - upon waking, everyone gears up, heads back through the throne room, and files one-by-one into the crack that exudes frost.  

Steve wraps a rope around his midsection, hands one end to and darts into the large chamber where Silja indicates her pack has been stashed. He tip-toes his way deep into the room before drawing the attention of the spider occupants.  As their heads turn toward the halfling, he madly dashes to grab the pack and return to his friends.  Small spiders swarm from the walls and ceiling, biting Steve and slowing him down.  The group turns around and manages to execute a more-or-less orderly retreat -- as much as that can be done while being harried by spiderlings nipping at their skin.

Once they reach the safety of the statue room, Silja grabs her large book, an apparent necessity to translate the runic giant language.  Steve pockets the remainder of the pack, including some halfling rations.

### Statue room
Silja translates for us - the runs on the portal are the type of giants: frost giant, storm giant, etc.
The group puts their heads together, trying to break the code of how to get the portal to open. After several failed attempts, Harshnag picks up the axe held by the front giant statue and touches it to the rune of the same name.  As soon as the axe comes into contact with the wall, the frosty portal begins to change.

### Frosty portal
As the frost resolves into a misty thundercloud, most of the group steps through, leaving Aloine and Silja behind in the statue room.  There are several figures with lights and a dead giant lying on an inscription.

- Body in the room
- Questions to the oracle thing
- Confrontation between Savien and Harshnag
- Questions:
- From Savian - Where is King Hekaton?
	- Unknown, shielded from their eyes
	- From Harshnag: Where's my friend?
		- captive of Sansuri
	- Why?
		- ()
	- What is the story is the breaking of the ordning?
		- King was misled by his daughters (specifically Mirran and Nym, who the oracles claim coveted his throne; the only daughter you had previously been aware of is named Serissa - the youngest daughter/currently on the throne according the mage in Everlund)
		- More powerful giant lords had broken from King's court, willing to risk everything to ascend to the top
		- Stop one to stop them all
	- How do we find those responsible?
		- Find a magic conch of the storm giant king that can be used to visit Hekaton's court
	- How can we find a magic conch of the storm giant king?
		- Retrieve the relics of giant lords from various battle fields and return them to the temple
		
As the last light winks out, the group exits the portal and returns to the statue room.  Silja draws a map of known giant battles pointing out one particular battle that , likely sources for finding magic conchs.

### Exit
As the group leaves the cave, they are confronted by a group of reptilian, leather-bound figures.  One steps forward ominously and says: 

`The great dragon Klauth offers you this vessel to cross the dangerous terrain. We will crew the boat - if you manage to quell the giant threat, return to Klauth's hidden vale and you will be greatly rewarded.`
