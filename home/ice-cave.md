<!-- TITLE: Ice Cave -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Spiders, Dragons, and Boulders: Oh My! -->

### Entry
After a long journey from Everlund, the group led by [Harshnag](/people/harshnag) arrived at a cave.  Upon entry, they were confronted by a group of people - who, unfortunately, did not speak common, giant, or abyssal.

### Fight with the welcome crew

### The split
Aloine, Lia, and Savien head to the north while Largo, Steve, and Orel head through a fissure to the West.

#### Largo, Steve, and Orel
Deep in the ice caces, Large, Steve, and Orel run into multiple groups of small icy spiders.  Attacking in groups of three to five, their mandibles pierce the skin, forcing our heroes to resist being chilled to the bone.  Steve dismembered one spider, keeping a vial of [icy liquid](/items/icy-spider-juice) for himself and slicing [several legs](/items/icy-spider-legs) for Largo to keep.  Sensing their overwhelming strength, one spider attempts to escape by freezing a barricade into the tunnel -- however, Orel smashes the barricade and mutters a prayer to his god, allowing Largo to dash through and smash the spider into steam. The characters are left with a distinct visual afterimage of a heated imprint of Orel's god seared into Largo's trusty cast iron frying pan.

The group finds a large room with a giant ice spider and several smaller spiders protecting a brood of (presumably) sipder eggs.  Heroically, Orel charges to the middle of the room, aiming to smash a natural stone column and disrupt the extensive protective icy web system.  His vision (perhaps clouded from his earlier ice cloud encounter) betrayed him, and he misjudged the location of the large spider, who blasted him with a coating of ice, freezing him in stone.  Largo and Steve rush into the room and push the block back into the tunnels.  Largo heats up his cast iron pan and smashes Orel free.  Discretion being the better part of valor, the three continue to explore the tunnels, leaving the spider queen to her machinations.

Further exploration reveals an opening to the side of the mountain housing the cave system.  Largo and Orel leave some souvenirs of their visit...  Further search uncovers a second large chamber and three blocks of ice (an exsanguinated mountain goat, an unfortunate halfling mountain climber, and surprisingly a living but frozen dwarf woman).  Orel carries the dwarf woman through the tunnels.

#### Savien, Lia, and Aloine (and Hermes)
Meanwhile, Savien, Lia, and Aloine step into a tunnel, unwittingly triggering a giant boulder to crash through the room.
